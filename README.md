# 1.PTT Board Crawler Data Collection and Storage
# Project Overview
This program is an efficient PTT web crawler tool implemented using Python and BeautifulSoup. It allows batch scraping of specified PTT boards, including key information such as article titles, content, comments, authors, and more. The collected data is structured and exported to a CSV file, making it ideal for data analysis, social insights, and academic research.
# Key Features
1.	Customizable Crawling Parameters
o	Users can freely set board names and the number of pages to scrape.
o	Supports batch scraping of multiple boards to meet diverse data requirements.
2.	Comprehensive Data Extraction
o	Extracts article titles, content, publication time, authors, and comment details.
o	Classifies comments into likes (Like), dislikes (Boo), neutral comments, and total comment counts.
3.	Data Integration and Output
o	Automatically structures the data into a Pandas DataFrame.
o	Exports results to a CSV file for easy sharing and analysis.
4.	Stability and Error Handling
o	Custom exception handling ensures resilience against common issues like page not found or deleted articles.
o	Program execution continues seamlessly even when encountering errors.
5.	High-Efficiency Design
o	Supports batch scraping of multi-page content across specified boards.
o	Displays scraping progress and consolidates results efficiently.
# Usage Instructions
1. Run the Program
Users can modify parameters within the program to set target boards:
broad = ['womentalk', 'Contacts', 'optical', 'Laser_eye']  # Specify boards to scrape  
page_num = 50  # Number of pages to scrape per board  
2. Execution Process
When the program runs, it will display the progress dynamically:
yaml
Scraping board: womentalk  
Scraping board: Contacts  
Scraping complete, data saved to ptt_data.csv  
3. Output Data
•	Results are automatically exported to a CSV file: ptt_data.csv
•	Encoding: UTF-8-sig, ensuring proper display of Chinese characters.
